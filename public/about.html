        Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison[1] were introduced to Atari's
        arcade game Touch Me at the Music Operators of America (MOA) trade show
        in 1976.[2] Baer said of the product, "Nice gameplay. Terrible
        execution. Visually boring. Miserable, rasping sounds."[2] The prototype
        built by Baer used the low-cost Texas Instruments TMS 1000
        microcontroller chip, which was in many games of the 1970s. Lenny
        Cope,[2] who was one of Ralph H. Baer's partners, programmed the core of
        the game, titled Follow Me at the time. Baer developed the tones of the
        game, inspired by the notes of a bugle. When they pitched the demo, an
        8-by-8-inch console, to the Milton Bradley Company the name of the game
        was changed to Simon. Simon debuted in 1978 at a retail price of $24.95
        (equivalent to $104 in 2021) and became one of the top-selling toys that
        Christmas shopping season.[2][3] U.S. Patent 4,207,087: "Microcomputer
        controlled game", was granted in 1980.[1] Milton Bradley soon
        capitalized on the original with both the smaller-sized Pocket Simon and
        the expanded, eight-button Super Simon.

        Many variants of Simon have been made since Hasbro acquired Milton
        Bradley in the 1980s, building on the possibilities offered by advances
        in technology. The original Super Simon was reinvented in 2003 as a
        hexagonal unit with six buttons, which was only released in Europe. 2000
        saw Simon Squared (or Simon2), a unit with the four traditional buttons
        on one side, and a set of eight smaller buttons on the other. In 2004,
        Hasbro released the Simon Stix. The game features two electronic sticks
        (modeled after drumsticks), an emphasis on the musical part of the game,
        and features four levels of play.[4]

        In 2005, Hasbro released Simon Trickster[5] (also known as Simon Tricks
        in Europe and in the UK, and as Simon Genius in Brazil), which features
        four game modes, in a similar fashion to another Hasbro game, Bop It,
        and colored lenses instead of buttons. "Simon Classic" mode plays up to
        35 tones (notes). "Simon Bounce" is similar to "Simon Classic", but
        instead the colors of the lenses change. "Simon Surprise" is one of the
        most difficult games in the unit. Every lens becomes the same color and
        the player has to memorize the location. "Simon Rewind" requires the
        player to memorize the sequence backwards. During each game, the player
        is paid a compliment after a certain number of tones is completed. On
        reaching five and eleven tones, the computer will randomly choose
        "Awesome!", "Nice!", "Sweet!" or "Respect!". On reaching 18 tones, the
        game will play a victory melody three times. On reaching the ultimate 35
        tones, the game will play the victory melody again and will say
        "Respect!". If the player fails to memorize the pattern or fails to
        press the right color within the time limit, the game will play a
        crashing sound and the game will say "Later!".

        In 2011, Hasbro introduced Simon Flash. In this version, the game is
        played with four cube-shaped electronic modules that the player must
        move around depending on the game mode.[6]

        In 2013, Hasbro reinvented Simon once again with Simon Swipe. The game
        was demonstrated at the New York Toy Fair 2014 and released that
        summer.[7] The game is a circular unit that looks like a steering wheel.
        It has been extended from four buttons to eight touchscreen buttons,
        which are flattened out on the unit.[8] The game features four game
        modes, called "Levels" (the main game), "Classic", "Party" and
        "Extreme". The player has to go through all sixteen levels to beat the
        game. "Classic", "Party" and "Extreme" levels focus on one pattern
        getting longer and longer until the player is out. A smaller version of
        the game, called Simon Micro Series, was introduced in the fall of 2014.
        This version has only two game modes called "Solo" and "Pass It" and
        features 14 levels and four buttons. There is also a version of Simon
        created by Basic Fun known as the Touch Simon. This version has an LCD
        screen and plays melodies at specific parts of the game.

        In 2016, Hasbro launched the follow-up to Simon Swipe with Simon Air.
        The game was announced at a Hasbro press conference before the 2016 New
        York Toy Fair. This version of Simon uses motion sensors, similar to
        those in Mattel's Loopz line of games. The game has three game modes:
        "Solo", "Classic" and "Multiplayer".[9] A button-pressing version of
        Simon was also released in the US, with an aesthetic recalling that of
        the 1970s and 1980s models. Recently, Hasbro has released Simon Optix, a
        headset game with a motion sensor technology similar to Simon Air.
