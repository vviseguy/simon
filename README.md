## Simon

This repository will hold my files for the mock Simon application that I will be creating as part of CS 260 Web Applications.

Currently, the project is only html and css.

# Things I have learned

* That I can spend way too much time on css...
* `box-sizing: border-box;` is a very useful change to make.
* Box-shadows have a lot of applications
